# README-creator

## Description

This is a command-line application that uses Node.js. This application generates a README.md file by prompting the user with questions and plugs the responses into the corrolating position in the README file. This project uses  NPM package, Inquirer version 8.2.4.

## Installation

Clone the README-creator to your computer.
Install inquirer by using <npm i inquirer@8.2.4> into a pachage.json file.
Using the terminal, type <node index> into the command line and that will tell node to read the index.js file which will then prompt the questions.
Once all the questions are answered, that will then create your README.md file and put it in the "generated" folder.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
